# ConnectFour

This is a simple implementation of the classic game Connect Four in dotnet Blazor.

## How to Play

The game is played on a vertical board which has seven hollow columns and six rows. Each column has a hole in the upper part of the board, where pieces are introduced. There is a window which shows the board, two labels with the names (and colors) of the players, and a button to start a new game.

The game starts with an empty board.

Players take turns dropping one of their pieces into any of the seven columns, trying to get four in a row vertically, horizontally or diagonally.

The first player to get four in a row wins.
